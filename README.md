# polidatacompressor
Summary:
The present project refers to a programming to be used in databases,
computer systems, mobile applications, smart electronic devices and new
Blockchains, to generate more space savings on memories, hard drives or any
other data storage device, in addition to increasing the speed in data
transmission and reception. Ideal for software makers, mobile application
developers, and smart electronic device creators (IOT).
The most Blockchains receive a huge load of data and it is believed that
in the next years they should receive and keep records of thousands of different
information. Currently, there is no specific data packer for this purpose, and the
values charged by the miners already consider the number of bytes to be
stored.
The system in question will allow energy savings and the prices of the
tariffs charged for storage in these types of block databases, precisely by
compressing the data before storing them.
The main focus is licensing negotiations for application and software
vendors that using Blockchain for data storage. As well as, Blockchains
manufacturers and intelligent electronic solutions (IOT).
This system is a set of algorithms, which aims to be used for a compress,
according to the type of data that represents the information to be stored.
For a numeric field a specific algorithm is used, for an alphanumeric field
another algorithm is used and for a date field a recommendation with numerical
algorithm application.
